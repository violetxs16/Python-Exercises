#Fruits into baskets
#Difficulty: Medium
#Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
#you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
#The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

#You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. 
#You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., 
#you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

#Solution: Sliding window approach
